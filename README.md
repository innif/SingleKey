# SingleKey
This android-app adresses the issue of internet users using one password for all their accounts. This app allows you to generate secure passwords based on only one master-password.
This app combines your master-password and the name of the service you need a password for, to create a new and save password out of it. There is no need to store any data or to make an account. Just use the password, this app provides and if you want to know your password again, just enter your master-password and the name of the service and the app will generate the same password again.

This app is currently in alpha, so please do not use it, to generate your passwords yet. The algorithm for the password-generation will change in alpha-phase.
